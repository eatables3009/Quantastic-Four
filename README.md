the files named chat_1.py , chat_2.py and chat_server.py are the chat simulation codes.
the files named encryption_c1.py , encryption_c2.py , and encryption_server.py are the codes for the encryption software. 
the chat simulation runs as an ideal front face and does not show the back end working. to see the encryption software working in real time, we have also provided the code for the software seperately. in this the server only receives the encrypted code and has no way to decode it. each client has its own private key which is used on top of the encryption by the server.
